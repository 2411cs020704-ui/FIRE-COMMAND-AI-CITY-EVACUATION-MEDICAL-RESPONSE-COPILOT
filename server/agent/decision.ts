Decide:

   - optimize_transit (for traffic congestion or transport failures)
   - reoute_waste (for waste surge or collection optimization)
   - manage_density (for housing/occupancy stress)
2. Priority level based on severity and operational impact.
3. Provide reasoning focusing on SDG 11 targets (Safety, Sustainability, Efficiency).
